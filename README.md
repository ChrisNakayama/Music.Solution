Music.Solution

Chris Nakayama

Music.Solution is a response to the request from a good friend who owns a record shop needing an application that creates a searchable database that can be cast onto selling platforms and then inventory is tracked and the database of record objects is updated as they sell. The main database would house music objects that are searchable by their key values. 

The base line MVP would be an API with an MVC that could create and store a music object. The music object could then be searched and displayed through the MVC. The program could offer the music object for sale. If the music object is sold, Then the program indecates that the object has sold. The program could update the music object to sold and change the category so that it was searchable, but indecate that it sold. The music object would have a key value to indecate if the object was sold or unsold.


The tools I will use are: HTML, CSS, C#, Javascript, CQL 

If I finish developing the MVP, I would like to work on making the logic to cast the database onto a selling platform and track weather the items sell or not. I will have to work with the specific selling platforms to meet the technology requirements and provide the necessary resources to effectively link my database and program to said selling platform.

Activity and Research Log

1. Research for API Technology and baseline projects to emulate. Finding what exists already and initial research. 4 hours. 6.18.22

2. The project might change to a web app that uses the Discogs API to search and track music objects for sale. A user could search titles through Discogs, add their stock to the API and track sales. 6.19.22

3. Research for Discogs API. 6.19.22
Looking at the Discogs API 10am till 12pm

4. Api C# and Microsoft Cql research. ASP.NET
